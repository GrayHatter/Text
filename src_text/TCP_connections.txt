TCP_connections is what takes care of handling multiple TCP client instances to establish a reliable connection via TCP relays to a friend. Only connecting to a friend with one relay would not be very reliable so this level of abstraction is needed to take care of this. For example it makes sure that if a relay goes down then the connection to the peer will not be impacted. This is done by connecting to the other peer with more than one relay.

TCP_connections is above TCP_client and below net_crypto. 

A TCP connection in TCP_connections is defined as a connection to a peer though one or more TCP relays. To connect to another peer with TCP_connections, a connection in TCP_connections to the peer with DHT public key X will be created. Some TCP relays which we know the peer is connected to will then be associated to that peer. Those relays will be the relays the peer has sent to us via the onion module if the peer isn't connected directly yet. The peer will also send some relays he is connected to directly once a connection is established however this is done by another module.

TCP_connections has a list of all relays it is connected to. It tries to keep the number of relays it is connected to as small as possible. This is done in order to minimize load on relays and lower bandwidth usage for the client. The desired number of TCP relay connections per peer is set to 3 in toxcore with the maximum number set to 6. The reason for these numbers is that 1 would mean no backup relays and 2 would mean only 1. To be sure that the connection is reliable 3 seems to be the good number. The maximum number of 6 is the maximum number of relays that can be tied to each peer. if 2 peers are connected each to the same 6+ relays and they both need to be connected to that amount of relays because of other friends this is where this maximum comes into play.

If necessary, TCP_connections will connect to some TCP relays in order to use them to send onion packets. This is only done when there is no UDP connection to the network. When there is a UDP connection, packets are sent with UDP only because sending them with TCP relays can be less reliable. It is also important that we are connected at all times to some relays as these relays will be used by TCP only peers to initiate a connection to us.

In toxcore each client is connected to 3 relays even if there are no TCP peers and the onion is not needed. It may be better to only connect to those relays when toxcore is initializing as this is the only time when peers will connect to us via TCP relays we are connected to. Due to how the onion works, after the initialization phase where each peer is searched in the onion and then if they are found the info required to connect back (DHT pk, TCP relays) is sent to them, there should be no more peers connecting to us via TCP relays. This may be a way to further reduce load on TCP relays however more research is needed.

TCP_connections picks one relay and uses it and only it to send data to the other peer. The reason for not picking a random connected relay for each packet is that it severely deteriorates the quality of the link between two peers and makes performance of lossy video and audio transmissions really bad. For this reason one peer is picked and used to send all data. If for any reason no more data can be sent to that relay, the next relay is used. Reasons for that include the TCP socket being full which means that the relay should not be dropped if this occurs. Relays are only dropped if they time out, if they become useless (if the relay is one too many or is no longer used to relay data to any peers).

TCP_connections also contains a mechanism to make connections go to sleep. TCP connections to other peers may be put to sleep if the connection to the peer establishes itself with UDP after the connection is established with TCP. UDP is the method preferred by net_crypto to communicate with other peers. In order to keep which relays were used to connect with the other peer in case the UDP connection fails, they are saved by TCP_connections when the connection is put to sleep. Any relays used only by this connection are saved then disconnected from. If the connection is awakened, the relays are reconnected to and the connection is reestablished. Putting a connection to sleep is the same as saving all the relays used by the connection and removing the connection. Awakening the connection is the same as creating a new connection with the same parameters and then adding back all the relays.

A method to detect potentially dysfunctional relays that try to disrupt the network by lying that they are connecting to a peer when they are not or that maliciously drop all packets should be considered. Toxcore doesn't currently implement such a system and adding one requires more research and likely also requires extending the protocol.

When TCP connections connects to a relay it will create a new TCP_client instance for that relay. At any time if the TCP_client instance reports that it is disconnected, the TCP relay will be dropped. Once the TCP relay reports that it is connected, TCP_connections will find all the connections that are associated to the relay and announce to the relay that it wants to connect to each of them with routing requests. If the relay reports that the peer for a connection is online, the connection number and relay will be used to send data in that connection with data packets. If the peer isn't reported as online but the relay is associated to a connection, TCP OOB packets will be used to send data instead of data packets. TCP OOB packets are used because in this case the relay most likely has the peer connected however they have not sent a routing request to connect to us.

TCP_connections is used as the bridge between individual TCP_client instances and net_crypto, or the bridge between individual connections and something that requires an interface that looks like one connection.
